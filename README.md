# hexidecimal-adder

In this project, I designed, built, and tested a simple hexadecimal adder, focusing on the calculation 𝑌 = 𝐴 + 𝐵, where 𝐴, 𝐵, and 𝑌 represented four-bit unsigned numbers ranging from 𝑥"0" to 𝑥"𝐹". I created a VHDL model of the adder and validated it through simulation and benchtop testing. The project involved distinguishing between the datapath and controller, which helped me understand their roles in complex system design. To operate the calculator, I used two synchronized and debounced pushbutton controls: one for clearing the calculator and another for executing operations. Four slide switches emulated the keypad input for the two operands. I followed a sequence of steps: first, setting the first operand and displaying it; next, entering the second operand and displaying it; then, completing the calculation and showing the result. I also included a mechanism to indicate overflow when the result exceeded 15, illuminating the decimal point on the display. My design incorporated several sub-components, including the datapath for core functions, a controller for timing regulation, an input conditioning module, a clock divider circuit for generating the system clock, and a driver for the seven-segment display. I also utilized a top-level shell to integrate the components, a constraints file for external I/O connections, and a testbench to validate the datapath and controller through simulation.
